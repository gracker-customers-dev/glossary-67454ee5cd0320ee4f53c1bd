          "In the context of non-human identities, a 'Bot' refers to a software program that operates autonomously, often over the internet, to perform repetitive tasks that would be time-consuming or impractical for humans. Bots can simulate human behavior and interact with users, websites, or other bots. They are used for a variety of purposes, including customer service, data collection, and content generation. For instance, chatbots serve as virtual assistants on websites, answering customer queries and providing information. Other bots, such as web crawlers, index content for search engines, while social media bots may automate posting or engage with users for marketing purposes. Bots can operate with varying degrees of complexity, from simple rule-based systems to advanced AI-driven applications capable of machine learning. The rise of bots has significantly changed how companies interact with customers and manage online tasks, but their use also raises concerns about authenticity, privacy, and the potential for misuse in spreading misinformation or automating malicious activities.",

          "System accounts are specialized accounts used by software applications, services, and automated processes to perform tasks without human intervention. These accounts typically have predefined permissions and access rights tailored to the specific needs of the application or service they support. Unlike human user accounts, system accounts do not have personal identifiers and are not associated with a specific individual. They are essential for enabling secure and efficient operation of various systems, such as databases, web servers, and cloud services. System accounts can be categorized based on their functionality, such as service accounts, application accounts, or daemon accounts. Proper management of system accounts is critical to maintaining security, as they can be targeted by attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in automated processes. Regular audits, strict access controls, and adherence to the principle of least privilege are vital practices for safeguarding system accounts.",

          "In the realm of digital identity, a non-human/person account refers to profiles or accounts that do not correspond to real human beings but instead represent entities such as businesses, pets, fictional characters, or even automated bots. These accounts can serve various purposes, including marketing, community engagement, or providing information and entertainment. For example, a company may have a social media account to interact with customers, while a pet might have an account to share their daily adventures. Non-human/person accounts can be beneficial for organizations to establish a brand presence or for community initiatives. However, they can also raise issues concerning authenticity, as the distinction between human and non-human accounts might not always be clear. This raises questions about representation, transparency, and the nature of online interactions. Understanding the implications of non-human identities is crucial in today's digital landscape, where the lines between human and non-human accounts increasingly blur.",

In this context, HMI plays a crucial role in ensuring that users can communicate their needs and commands to machines while also receiving feedback and information in a comprehensible manner. This interaction can take various forms, including graphical user interfaces (GUIs), touch screens, voice commands, and even augmented reality systems. As machines become increasingly autonomous and capable of performing complex tasks, the design of HMI systems becomes essential to ensure safety, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Effective HMI design considers user experience, accessibility, and the specific capabilities of non-human identities, allowing for seamless collaboration and operation across diverse environments.",

These entities can engage in complex decision-making processes, learn from their environments, and adapt their behaviors according to experiences. Class 2 identities often challenge traditional notions of personhood by demonstrating capabilities usually attributed to sentient beings, such as emotional responses, social interactions, or creative expression. Examples might include sophisticated AI systems that can generate art, compose music, or engage in conversation with humans in a meaningful way. Class 2 identities are typically contrasted with Class 1, which includes simpler, reactive systems that lack true autonomy. The implications of Class 2 entities raise important ethical and philosophical questions regarding rights, responsibilities, and the nature of consciousness in non-human forms.",
          "## Examples",
          "- An advanced AI that can create original artwork and discuss its creative process.\n- A robot with emotional intelligence that can form relationships with humans.",

In the context of non-human identities, OAuth 2.0 facilitates secure interactions between services and applications without requiring users to share their credentials. This is particularly useful for service accounts or machine-to-machine communications where traditional user authentication is not practical. OAuth 2.0 employs access tokens to grant access, which can be scoped to limit the permissions granted to the application. It supports various grant types, including client credentials, which is specifically designed for non-human identities. This allows systems to authenticate and authorize themselves to access resources without direct user involvement. The framework enhances security by minimizing credential exposure and providing mechanisms for token revocation and expiration, thereby helping organizations manage access efficiently and securely.",

          "In the context of non-human identities, a digital identity refers to the unique set of digital attributes, behaviors, and representations associated with entities that are not human, such as organizations, machines, or software agents. This identity is created and maintained through various digital interactions, including social media profiles, website presence, and online transactions. Non-human entities use digital identities to engage in activities online, such as providing services, sharing information, or interacting with users. These identities can embody characteristics like brand values, operational capabilities, and service offerings. Importantly, digital identities for non-human entities must be managed carefully to ensure security, privacy, and brand integrity, as they can be subject to cyber threats and misuse. The evolution of artificial intelligence and IoT (Internet of Things) further complicates this landscape, as machines and algorithms develop their own identities and roles within digital ecosystems.",

          "Credential stuffing is a type of cyber attack that exploits the tendency of users to reuse the same login credentials across multiple websites and applications. Attackers obtain sets of usernames and passwords, often from previous data breaches, and then use automated tools to test these credentials on a wide range of online services. Because many users do not create unique passwords for different accounts, a successful login can occur even if the credentials were originally compromised from just one site. This method poses a significant threat to non-human identities, such as bots or automated accounts, which can be generated to mimic legitimate users. These non-human entities can exploit access to automate fraudulent activities, such as making purchases, sending spam, or scraping data. Credential stuffing attacks can lead to significant financial losses for organizations and compromise personal data security for users. To mitigate these risks, companies are encouraged to implement measures such as multi-factor authentication and monitoring for unusual login patterns.",
          "## Examples",
          "- An attacker uses credentials leaked from a data breach to access multiple user accounts on an e-commerce site.\n- A bot utilizes credential stuffing to gain access to social media accounts, allowing it to spread misinformation or spam.",

          "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security measure that enhances the protection of non-human identities, such as applications, services, and devices, by requiring multiple forms of verification before granting access. Unlike traditional single-factor authentication methods that rely solely on passwords, MFA incorporates at least two or more independent credentials from different categories: something you know (like a password), something you have (like a security token or a mobile device), and something you are (like biometric verification). In the context of non-human identities, MFA is crucial for ensuring that automated processes, APIs, and machine-to-machine communications are secure and that only authorized entities can access sensitive data or perform critical functions. This approach reduces the risk of unauthorized access and enhances overall security posture, especially in environments where automated scripts or services operate without direct human intervention. As threats to digital identities continue to evolve, implementing MFA for non-human identities is becoming increasingly important for organizations aiming to safeguard their systems and data.",

          "## Description",
          "In the context of Non-Human Identities (NHIs), manual intervention refers to the need for human oversight or action in automated processes that involve digital entities or services. NHIs operate through algorithms and predefined rules, often lacking the ability to make nuanced decisions in complex or unforeseen situations. Therefore, when an NHI encounters a scenario that it cannot handle appropriately—such as data discrepancies, errors in processing, or unexpected user interactions—manual intervention becomes necessary. This human involvement can take many forms, from simple troubleshooting and error correction to more complex decision-making tasks. The goal of manual intervention is to ensure that the automated systems function correctly, maintain integrity, and provide value without compromising security or user experience. As organizations increasingly rely on NHIs for various operations, the importance of having an effective manual intervention strategy becomes crucial to mitigate risks and enhance overall efficiency.",

          "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. In the context of non-human identities, AI encompasses a range of technologies and systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. AI operates through algorithms and large data sets, enabling systems to learn from experience and adapt to new inputs. Non-human identities, such as robots, virtual assistants, and autonomous systems, utilize AI to interact with their environment and users in a way that appears intelligent. The development of AI raises important questions about the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and the ethical implications of creating entities that can think or act independently. As AI continues to evolve, it challenges the traditional distinctions between human and machine, prompting discussions about rights, responsibilities, and the future of work in a world increasingly populated by intelligent systems.",

These containers serve as lightweight, portable units that bundle together the necessary components for these entities to function independently and efficiently. By isolating non-human identities in this way, organizations can easily manage, deploy, and scale them across different environments, ensuring consistency and reducing conflicts with other systems. This method is particularly useful in microservices architectures, where multiple non-human identities interact to perform complex tasks. Containerization enhances security, as each identity operates within its own environment, minimizing the risk of cross-contamination.

          "Access control in the context of Non-Human Identities refers to the mechanisms and policies that govern the ability of automated systems, applications, and devices to interact with resources in a secure manner. Unlike traditional access control, which primarily involves human users, this concept focuses on identifying and managing non-human entities such as IoT devices, bots, and applications. These entities often require specific permissions to access data or perform actions within a network. Effective access control ensures that only authorized non-human identities can access sensitive information or critical systems, thereby reducing the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches. It involves the use of authentication methods (such as API keys, tokens, or certificates) and authorization protocols that define the rights and privileges of these entities. The challenge lies in creating robust access control mechanisms that can adapt to the dynamic nature of non-human identities, which may change frequently based on their functions or contexts.",

          "In the context of non-human identities, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) refers to the security process that requires multiple forms of verification to authenticate entities such as applications, services, or devices rather than human users. Non-human identities are often used in automated processes and can include APIs, bots, and various online services that interact without direct human intervention. Implementing MFA for these identities enhances security by ensuring that even if one method of authentication (like an API key) is compromised, additional factors are required to gain access. Typically, MFA may involve a combination of something the identity knows (like a secret key), something it has (like a token or certificate), and something it is (biometric verification, though less common for non-human identities). This layered security approach helps mitigate risks associated with credential theft and automated attacks, making it difficult for unauthorized users to impersonate legitimate non-human identities.",

          "## Description",
          "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security mechanism used to restrict system access to authorized users based on their role within an organization. In the context of non-human identities, such as applications, services, or automated processes, RBAC allows organizations to define roles that can be assigned to these non-human entities. Each role is associated with a set of permissions that dictate what actions the entity can perform and which resources it can access. This model simplifies management by allowing administrators to assign permissions to roles rather than to individual non-human identities, making it easier to maintain security policies as the system evolves. For example, a cloud application might have roles like 'DataProcessor' or 'ReportGenerator', each with specific permissions tailored to their functions. This approach not only enhances security but also streamlines compliance with regulatory requirements by ensuring that only authorized entities perform sensitive operations.",
          "## Examples",
          "- A backup service with a role that allows it to access and restore data from the database.\n- An API service assigned a role that permits it to read data from a specific dataset without write access.",

It is primarily designed to work with web applications and APIs, enabling secure authorization without sharing user credentials. In the context of Non-Human Identities, OAuth facilitates machine-to-machine interactions where services or applications can authenticate and authorize on behalf of users or other systems. For instance, when an application needs to access a user's data from a service, OAuth enables it to request access tokens from an authorization server instead of directly handling user passwords. These tokens can be scoped to limit access to specific resources, ensuring enhanced security. Non-Human Identities often represent automated processes or applications, making OAuth crucial for granting them the ability to perform actions securely and efficiently, such as accessing APIs or integrating with various cloud services.",

This includes identities created for machines, applications, or services that require identification and authentication in digital environments. The lifecycle typically encompasses several phases: creation, provisioning, maintenance, and retirement. During creation, NHIs are established with specific attributes and access rights. Provisioning involves integrating these identities into systems and ensuring they have the necessary permissions. Maintenance includes monitoring usage, updating attributes, and ensuring compliance with security policies. Finally, retirement involves decommissioning identities that are no longer needed, ensuring that access is revoked and sensitive data is handled appropriately. Effective lifecycle management ensures that NHIs are secure, compliant, and functional throughout their existence, minimizing risks associated with identity theft or unauthorized access.",

          "Non-Human Identities (NHIs) represent a diverse spectrum of entities that challenge our conventional understanding of identity, which is often anthropocentric. NHIs include sentient beings such as animals that exhibit complex social behaviors or emotions, and artificial intelligences that possess unique personalities or decision-making capabilities. Moreover, mythological creatures and supernatural entities also fall under this category, as they are often attributed with their own identities and narratives within various cultures. The study of NHIs raises important questions about agency, rights, and ethical considerations, especially as technology evolves and non-human entities become more integrated into daily life. For example, the recognition of animal rights prompts discussions about how we perceive the identities of animals based on their cognitive and emotional capacities. Similarly, the development of advanced AI challenges us to reconsider what it means to have an identity beyond the human experience. As society's understanding of identity expands, NHIs are increasingly relevant in discussions surrounding ethics, technology, and interspecies relationships.",

          "Contextual Visibility refers to how non-human entities, such as artificial intelligence, animals, or plants, are perceived and acknowledged in various environments and situations. This concept emphasizes that the visibility of these identities is not static; instead, it fluctuates based on the context in which they are situated. For instance, an AI may be highly visible in a tech conference setting, where its capabilities are discussed and showcased, but may be less visible in a social context where human interactions are prioritized. Similarly, a domesticated animal may have high visibility in a household setting, serving as a companion, while its role may be less recognized in agricultural settings. The implications of Contextual Visibility are significant for understanding how society interacts with and attributes value to non-human identities, impacting ethical considerations, policy-making, and the development of technology. Recognizing these shifts in visibility can lead to more inclusive approaches that account for the roles and rights of non-human entities across various domains.",

Additionally, non-human identities extend to artificial intelligences, which can develop unique identities based on their programming, interactions, and learning processes. These identities challenge conventional notions of personhood and agency, raising questions about rights, responsibilities, and representation. Furthermore, mythological and fictional beings, such as gods, spirits, and creatures from folklore, also constitute non-human identities, as they embody cultural narratives and values.

As organizations increasingly rely on automated systems and machine-to-machine communication, managing these identities becomes crucial to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity. Properly managing machine identities helps mitigate security risks, streamline operations, and facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements. In environments where devices and applications continuously interact, the proliferation of machine identities necessitates robust security measures, including identity lifecycle management, monitoring, and auditing, to protect against potential threats.",

This separation allows for better scalability, as each tier can be developed, modified, or scaled independently. In the context of Non-Human Identities (NHIs), which often interact with these applications, the architecture provides a structured way to manage identity access and control. NHIs can represent automated systems, bots, or service accounts that require distinct roles and permissions within each application tier. This modularity also enhances security, as each tier can implement its own security protocols to safeguard data and processes.

          "In the context of non-human identities, such as service accounts, bots, or application identities, misconfiguration occurs when these identities are not set up correctly according to best practices or security policies. This can include improper permissions, outdated keys, excessive access rights, or incorrect integration settings. Misconfigurations can expose systems to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruptions. For instance, a service account may have admin privileges when it should only have read access, or an API key might be left publicly accessible in code repositories. Additionally, misconfigurations may arise from a lack of oversight or understanding of the identity’s purpose, leading to unintended consequences. Regular audits and adherence to configuration management protocols are essential to mitigate these risks and ensure that non-human identities operate securely and efficiently.",

This concept challenges the anthropocentric view of identity by emphasizing that consciousness and identity can manifest in various forms beyond humans. For instance, animals exhibit complex social structures and emotional lives, suggesting that they possess their own identities. Similarly, advancements in artificial intelligence raise questions about the identities of sentient machines, which may develop their own form of consciousness. Furthermore, the exploration of extraterrestrial life expands the notion of identity to potentially include beings with entirely different biological and cognitive frameworks. The study of NHI invites interdisciplinary dialogue among fields such as philosophy, ethics, biology, and sociology, as it forces us to reconsider the moral implications of our relationships with non-human entities and the rights they should possess.",

          "In the context of non-human identities, redundancy refers to the design and implementation of systems, processes, or components that serve to ensure stability, reliability, and resilience of non-human entities, such as automated systems, artificial intelligence, or robotic networks. This concept is critical in high-stakes environments where failure can lead to significant consequences. Redundancy can take various forms, such as duplicate systems that can take over in case of failure, additional sensors that provide backup data, or alternative pathways for data processing. By integrating redundancy, designers can mitigate risks associated with system failures, thus enhancing the overall performance and safety of non-human identities. For instance, a spacecraft may have multiple navigation systems to ensure that if one fails, others can maintain the mission's course. Similarly, in AI, redundant algorithms can provide checks and balances to enhance decision-making accuracy and reliability.",

          "## Description",
          "A Handset generated OTP refers to a temporary, unique code produced by a mobile device, typically using a secure algorithm, to authenticate users during transactions or logins. This method is commonly employed in two-factor authentication (2FA) systems, where the OTP serves as a second layer of security beyond a traditional username and password. Unlike server-generated OTPs, which are sent via SMS or email, handset generated OTPs are generated directly on the user's device, often through dedicated applications like Google Authenticator or similar. This approach enhances security by reducing the risk of interception during transmission. Furthermore, handset generated OTPs are time-sensitive, expiring after a short duration, which adds an additional layer of security. These OTPs are especially beneficial for non-human identities, such as bots or automated systems, that require secure access to services without human intervention. They ensure that even automated processes can authenticate securely, thereby protecting sensitive data and services from unauthorized access.",
          "## Examples",
          "- A banking app generates an OTP for a user logging in from a new device.\n- An e-commerce platform uses a handset generated OTP for verifying transactions.",
          "## Additional Information",
          "- Handset generated OTPs can be based on time (TOTP) or event (HOTP) algorithms.\n- They improve security by eliminating the need for sending sensitive information over the network.",

Originally designed to manage dial-up access to the internet, RADIUS is now widely used for various types of network access, including VPNs, wireless networks, and more. In the context of non-human identities, RADIUS can support machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, where devices such as IoT sensors, servers, and applications need to authenticate against a centralized service. By employing RADIUS, organizations can ensure that non-human entities securely connect to their networks, receive appropriate access rights, and are logged for auditing purposes. RADIUS operates by sending user credentials from the client to a RADIUS server, which then verifies the credentials against a database and returns an appropriate response, allowing or denying access. This protocol is critical in environments where non-human identities interact with network resources, ensuring that only authorized devices are permitted access.",

          "Second Factor Authentication (2FA) enhances security by requiring not just a password (the first factor) but also a second form of verification. This is especially crucial for non-human identities, such as application accounts, APIs, or automated processes, where traditional username/password combinations may not suffice due to the risk of compromise. Non-human identities often interact with systems in ways that can be vulnerable to unauthorized access. By implementing 2FA, organizations can ensure that even if a password is stolen, an attacker would still need the second factor, which is typically something only the legitimate user has access to, such as a mobile device, hardware token, or biometric verification. This greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized actions being taken by automated systems or malicious actors pretending to be legitimate services. 2FA is a critical component in modern cybersecurity strategies, helping to protect sensitive data and operations by adding an additional layer of security beyond the password.",

          "Single Sign-Off (SSO) refers to a security mechanism that enables a non-human identity, such as an application, service account, or automated process, to securely log out from multiple connected systems with a single action. This is particularly important in environments where automated systems interact with various services and APIs, as it ensures that all open sessions are appropriately closed, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. For instance, if an automated service has been granted access to several APIs or cloud services, a Single Sign-Off ensures that when the service completes its operations or is decommissioned, it can revoke access across all these systems without needing to log out from each one individually. This enhances security by minimizing the window of opportunity for potential breaches and helps maintain compliance with security policies that require timely session termination. Additionally, it simplifies the management of non-human identities, which can often operate across extensive and complex IT landscapes.",
          "## Examples",
          "- An automated deployment service logs out from all cloud resources after completing a deployment.\n- A monitoring tool terminates sessions with all integrated APIs when it is no longer needed.",

          "Single-Sided Authentication refers to a security process in which only one party in a communication is authenticated. In the context of Non-Human Identities, this commonly involves scenarios where automated systems or applications authenticate themselves to a service or API without requiring the service to provide proof of its own identity. This is often seen in scenarios where machine-to-machine communication occurs, such as IoT devices communicating with cloud services. The authenticated party typically uses credentials like API keys, tokens, or client certificates to verify their identity to the server. The server accepts these credentials to grant access but does not provide any authentication back to the client. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, as the client may unknowingly communicate with a malicious server. Therefore, while single-sided authentication can simplify interactions, it is crucial to implement additional security measures to ensure that the identity of the server is also validated in sensitive applications.",

          "Three-factor authentication (3FA) is an advanced security protocol designed to enhance access control for non-human identities, such as machines, applications, or automated systems. Unlike traditional authentication methods that rely on one or two factors (something you know, something you have), 3FA incorporates an additional layer, making it more robust against unauthorized access. Typically, the three factors include: something a machine knows (like an API key or password), something a machine has (such as a hardware token or a cryptographic certificate), and something a machine is (biometric verification, like a fingerprint or voice recognition for systems capable of such measures). This multi-layered approach significantly reduces the risk of breaches, as an attacker would need to compromise multiple distinct elements to gain access. In environments where non-human identities operate critical tasks, such as cloud services, IoT devices, or automated systems, implementing 3FA can greatly enhance security and ensure compliance with industry standards.",

          "One-factor authentication (OFA) is a security mechanism used to verify the identity of non-human entities, such as applications, devices, or services, by requiring a single form of verification. In contrast to multi-factor authentication, which combines two or more verification methods, one-factor authentication relies solely on one type of credential. This may include something the non-human entity possesses, like an API key, a digital certificate, or a token. OFA is often simpler and faster to implement, making it suitable for scenarios where speed and ease of access are prioritized. However, it also presents a higher security risk, as having only one point of failure can make the system more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Despite its limitations, one-factor authentication is widely used in various applications, especially in environments where the risk of compromise is managed through other means, such as network security protocols and monitoring systems.",

          "## Description",
          "Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security mechanism that enhances the protection of non-human identities, such as automated systems, bots, and other digital entities. In the context of non-human identities, 2FA typically involves the use of two distinct methods of verification before granting access to sensitive resources or systems. The first factor is usually something the non-human entity knows, like an API key or password, while the second factor is often something the entity possesses, such as a cryptographic token, a certificate, or a response generated by an authentication app. This layered approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, as an attacker would need both factors to compromise the non-human identity. 2FA is particularly relevant in environments where automated processes interact with sensitive data or perform critical functions, ensuring that only legitimate automated identities can execute operations. By implementing 2FA, organizations can bolster their security posture against potential threats and breaches.",
          "## Examples",
          "- A bot accessing an API must provide both a password and a time-based one-time password (TOTP).\n- A cloud service uses a certificate along with a secret key to authenticate automated backup scripts.",
          "## Additional Information",
          "- 2FA can help mitigate the risks of credential theft and unauthorized access.\n- Implementing 2FA for non-human identities is becoming a best practice in cybersecurity.",

In the context of non-human identities, this concept extends to entities like IoT devices, applications, and organizations that require their own digital identities for interactions. With decentralised identity, these entities can authenticate themselves and establish trust in a peer-to-peer manner. This is typically achieved using blockchain technology or distributed ledger systems, which provide a secure and immutable record of identity claims. Non-human identities can benefit from decentralisation as it allows them to operate autonomously, make transactions, and communicate securely while maintaining control over their identity data. This approach mitigates risks associated with data breaches and central points of failure, enabling a more resilient and privacy-focused framework for identity management in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape.",

          "Biometric identification refers to the technology and methodology used to identify and verify the identity of non-human entities, such as animals or objects, based on their unique biological traits or characteristics. This process involves capturing specific biometric data, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, iris patterns, or even DNA, and analyzing it to create a unique identifier for the subject. Unlike traditional identification methods that rely on labels or tags, biometric identification leverages inherent physical attributes that are less prone to tampering or misidentification. In the context of non-human identities, this can be particularly useful in wildlife research, conservation efforts, and tracking of pets or livestock. For example, biometric identification can be used to monitor endangered species, ensuring that each individual is accurately tracked and studied without interference. The technology is evolving rapidly, with advancements in machine learning and image processing making these systems more efficient and reliable. Overall, biometric identification offers a sophisticated approach to recognizing and cataloging non-human entities in various fields.",

          "## Description",
          "Data retention refers to the policies and practices regarding the storage and management of information associated with non-human identities, such as automated systems, software agents, or IoT devices. In the context of non-human identities, data retention involves determining the types of data these entities generate or interact with, how long this data should be kept, and under what conditions it can be deleted or archived. This is crucial for compliance with legal and regulatory frameworks, which often dictate minimum and maximum retention periods. Furthermore, data retention policies help organizations manage data effectively, ensuring that valuable insights can be derived from historical data while minimizing storage costs and risks associated with data breaches. The decision on data retention can also affect the performance and usability of systems that rely on non-human identities, as outdated or irrelevant data can lead to inefficiencies.",
          "## Examples",
          "- An IoT device collecting environmental data retains records for analysis over a five-year period.\n- A software agent logs interactions with users and retains this data for compliance with user privacy regulations.",
          "## Additional Information",
          "- Data retention policies should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in regulations.\n- Organizations must balance the need for data retention with privacy concerns and the potential impact on data security.",

          "## Description",
          "In the realm of non-human identities, digital signatures play a crucial role in establishing trust and security in automated systems, such as IoT devices, software applications, and blockchain transactions. Non-human entities, like smart contracts or autonomous agents, often need to communicate and execute transactions without human intervention. A digital signature ensures that the data exchanged between these entities has not been tampered with and verifies the identity of the sender. This is accomplished through the use of public key infrastructure (PKI), where a private key is used to generate the signature, and a corresponding public key is used to verify it. This process helps prevent unauthorized access and assures users that the data originates from a legitimate source. As non-human identities become more prevalent in digital ecosystems, the reliance on robust digital signatures becomes essential for secure communications and transactions.",
          "## Examples",
          "- An IoT sensor sends data to a central server, digitally signing the message to ensure its authenticity.\n- A blockchain transaction is signed by a smart contract, verifying its legitimacy before being added to the ledger.",
          "## Additional Information",
          "- Digital signatures use asymmetric cryptography for enhanced security.\n- They provide non-repudiation, meaning the signer cannot deny having signed the message.",
